There can be many ways to write the notation, but for this repository I'll be giving the guidelines as to how to write so as to make sure that there aren't any discrepancies in this project. This is for myself and any contributors that wish to help, so make sure to read this and follow the notations.

## Basic Notes:
In music, Western music has different notes and Indian music has different notes. But the underlying theory behind them is the same, along with the frequency. All that is really different is *how* they are written.

## Western Music Notes vs Indian Music Notes

- Western music uses the notation: **Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti**
- Indian classical music uses the notation: ** सा, रे, ग, म, प, ध, नी**

These correspond to each other in the musical scale as:

| Western | Indian (Hindi Swar) |
|---------|---------------------|
| Do      | सा (Sa)             |
| Re      | रे (Re)             |
| Mi      | ग (Ga)              |
| Fa      | म (Ma)              |
| So      | प (Pa)              |
| La      | ध (Dha)             |
| Ti      | नी (Ni)             |

All these are the basic notes (or swaras) in their respective systems, and both have the same frequency pattern, but the notation and pronunciation differ.

## The Hindi Swars (स्वर):

- **सा (Sa)** 
- **रे (Re)**
- **ग (Ga)**
- **म (Ma)**
- **प (Pa)**
- **ध (Dha)**
- **नी (Ni)**

These are the seven basic swaras used in Indian classical music.

## Types of Swars:

In Indian classical music, the basic swaras can be altered to express different notes which are important to ragas and melodies.

- **Komal Swars (Soft Notes):** These are the "flat" notes, where the pitch is slightly lowered compared to the natural swar. There are only four Kimal Swars:
  - Komal रे (Re) – र_
  - Komal ग (Ga) – ग_
  - Komal ध (Dha) – ध_
  - Komal नी (Ni) – नी_

- **Teevra Swars (Sharp Notes):** These are the "sharp" notes, where the pitch is slightly higher than the natural swar.
  - Teevra म (Ma) – म# (This is the only teevra swar, it is higher than the natural Ma)

- **Vikrit Swars:** This term means "altered" or "modified" swars and refers generally to komal and teevra swars. These altered notes add expressiveness and variety to Indian classical music beyond the basic seven swaras.

# Saptak (सप्तक)
Like how Western music has "octaves", Indian music has "saptaks", it literally translates to "group of seven". 
There are three main Saptak's: Mandra (मंद्र) or Lower Octave, Madhya (मध्य) or Middle Octave, Taar (तार) or Higher Octave. These saptak's can  do ever lower or higher, but they are rarely used as the human voice cannot reach that low of high of a frequency.
Each swar has it's own frequency chart.

> There are even lower and higher saptak's, they are addressed with a prefix of "ati"- meaning extreme or beyond.

### Frequencies of Swaras in Hz (Hertz):

Frequencies represent how many sound vibrations occur per second. In Indian music, the frequency of the base note सा (Sa) can be chosen according to the singer's comfort, but commonly it is set roughly around **240-256 Hz** for Madhya Saptak.

Here is a common frequency chart for the three main saptaks (approximate values):

| Swar | Mandra Saptak (Lower octave) | Madhya Saptak (Middle octave) | Taar Saptak (Higher octave) |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| सा (Sa)   | 120 Hz                     | 240 Hz                       | 480 Hz                      |
| रे (Re)   | 135 Hz                     | 270 Hz                       | 540 Hz                      |
| ग (Ga)    | 144 Hz                     | 288 Hz                       | 576 Hz                      |
| म (Ma)    | 160 Hz                     | 320 Hz                       | 640 Hz                      |
| प (Pa)    | 180 Hz                     | 360 Hz                       | 720 Hz                      |
| ध (Dha)   | 202.5 Hz                   | 405 Hz                       | 810 Hz                      |
| नी (Ni)   | 216 Hz                     | 432 Hz                       | 864 Hz                      |

Some points you can use to remember them, because essentially you only need to remember the Madhya Saptak:
- Notes in the Mandra Saptak have frequencies approximately half of those in Madhya Saptak.
- Taar Saptak notes have double the frequencies of Madhya Saptak.
- The frequencies correspond to the specific pitches of each swar in different octaves, allowing music to cover a wide pitch range.

# Notations in different saptak's
- Madhya Saptak (most commonly used):
Here, no alteration is made to the swars and they are written as they normally are.
    - सा
    - रे
    - ग
    - म
    - प
    - ध
    - नी
- Mandra Saptak: 
Here, in traditional writing, a **dot is put right under the swar**, but because there isn't a framework that can do that in markdown format we will be using the '-' or negative sign.
    - सा-
    - रे-
    - ग-
    - म-
    - प-
    - ध-
    - नी-

Any subsequent lower octaves can have more '-' sign in front.
Like:
    - रे in ati-mandra saptak: रे--
- Taar Saptak:
Here, in traditional writing, a **dot is put right above the swar**, but again as there isn't a framework that can do that in markdown format, we'll be using the '+' or positive sign.
    - सा+
    - रे+
    - ग+
    - म+
    - प+
    - ध+
    - नी+

Similarly as in Mandra saptak, any subsequent lower octaves can have more '+' sign in front.
Like:
    - रे in ati-taar saptak: रे++
