You can write either in English or in Hindi, for how to write the swars you can write:

| Language | Swars |
|----------|-------|
| Engish | sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni |
| Hindi | सा, रे, ग, म, प, ध, नी |

As for how to write Sthai and Antra, you can:
Sthai
| 1 | 2 | 3 || 1 | 2 | 3 | <- This is the beat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sa | re | ma || pa | sa | ss | <- This is the swar |
| Jaa | n | abhi || na | jao | manao | <- This is the song |
| please | | not || dont | go | kajol | <- This is meaning (optional) |

ofc you can incorporate html tables if you want to but I suggest writing it in this given format so that it is easier for the editor to understand what's happening. And clearly, in this method writing the "meaning" of the sentences sung is a little hard right off the bat, so better suggestions are always wecome.
Or, you could alternatively write: 
| 1 | 2 | 3 || 1 | 2 | 3 | <- This is the beat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sa | re | ma || pa | sa | ss | <- This is the swar |
| Jaa | n | abhi || na | jao | manao | <- This is the song |
Meaning: My love please dont go 

maybe?
