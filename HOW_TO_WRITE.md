You can write either in English or in Hindi, for how to write the swars you can write:

| Language | Swars |
|----------|-------|
| Engish | sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni |
| Hindi | सा, रे, ग, म, प, ध, नी |

As for how to write Sthai and Antra, you can:
Sthai
| 1 | 2 | 3 || 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sa | re | ma || pa | sa | ss |

ofc you can incorporate html tables if you want to but I suggest writing it in this given format so that it is easier for the editor to understand what's happening.
