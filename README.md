> Note: you can write the bandish in Hindi or English, which ever is preferable. I personally will be writing in English because it would be much easier (otherwise I'd be banging my head on the keyboard).
> I ask that you write two files, one for English and one for Hindi. Eg: Bageshree_engilsh and Bageshree_hindi. This is only for help in better note keeping.

# Naming of files
For naming files for information of that particular Thaat, put a "0T_" before it and "_About" in front.
> eg: 0T_Kaafi_About.md
This is to keep the information about the Thaat at the top, and for better file management. The 0T is meant to keep it at the top of the file structure, and T signifies that that it is about the Thaat, not about the Raga.

For naming of folders of Ragas, they are to have a prefix of '1R_', this is to help in keeping the organisation structure.
> eg: 1R_Kaafi

For naming of the bandish of that raga, you are to make sure that the file of the bandish is in the folder of it's respective Raga. Make sure to include the title card for the markdown included in the SAMPLE_BANDISH.md keeping the format consistent
The start of the file name should be with 'BAN_' followed by the Raga name, that will keep it consistent for naming.
> eg: BAN_[bandish name].md

Each Raga wil have it's own about section, that Raga file will have the prefix of '0R', again '0' is meant to keep it at the top of the file structure while R signifies it is about the Raga.
> eg: 0R_Kaafi.md
