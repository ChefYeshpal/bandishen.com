> Note: you can write the bandish in Hindi or English, which ever is preferable. I personally will be writing in English because it would be much easier (otherwise I'd be banging my head on the keyboard).
> I ask that you write two files, one for English and one for Hindi. Eg: Bageshree_engilsh and Bageshree_hindi. This is only for help in better note keeping.
